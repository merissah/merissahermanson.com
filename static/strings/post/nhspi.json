    "content": "What is NHSPI you might ask? The NHSPI examines the health security preparedness of the nation by looking collectively at the health security preparedness of states. The main center pieces of this website are the three data visualizations. At a quick glance the user should be able to see how different states compare to the national average in their health security preparedness. \n\nI went with a very minimalistic approach to this site design. I only used small amounts of color to draw the users eye to the most important parts of the screen. I also color coordinated the 5 main security measures so the user could easily distinguish which measure was which between the three different visualizations. Each view displays the information in a different way so you can see everything from the national view, state view, bar graphs of the values, structure, and you can even drill down to the individual measures on the report view. I felt that the user should be able to switch back and forth through these views very quickly and easily so I used a visual navigation system right above the three views. This project was rather large and involved a small team of developers. This site included a CMS and a database for all of the measure values. I only handled the design for this project and worked with the developers to implement the design.",
