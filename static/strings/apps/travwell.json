It will also store your vaccine information for each destination, as well as give reminders for your next dose. It also has a packing list, to do list, a place to store your travel documents, and a profile section where you can see all of your information for every trip. \n\nNeedless to say this was a very large and complicated app. I handled all of the wire-framing for this app and had some input as far as the organization and how it should function. The client had a particular vision for the app and I accommodated accordingly. I handled all of the graphics for the app and worked with the developer to implement them. I went for a fun and colorful look and also made sure it corresponded with CDC's sister app 'Can I Eat This?'.",
