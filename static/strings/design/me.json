Due to resources, the re-design was limited to some re-organization and cosmetic issues.  Originally it was confusing to use, with most of the features hidden under an enormous settings dropdown. I gave it a completely new look. I simplified the interface and organized the incredibly feature rich application, into a more intuitive and streamline experience.",
